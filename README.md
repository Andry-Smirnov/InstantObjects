# **InstantObjects for Delphi**

![img](http://ethea.it/docs/InstantObjects/instantobjects_logo.gif)

Welcome to InstantObjects, the integrated framework for developing object-oriented business solutions in Delphi (from 2010 to 10.3 Rio version)

InstantObjects is a RAD technology that enables creation of applications based on persistent business objects. It simplifies the process of realizing ideas into products; shortens time-to-market, and helps keep business focus.

Even though it is still a bolted-on technology, InstantObjects integrates with the Delphi IDE and Object Pascal in a simple, flexible and intuitive manner. There are no sophisticated environments that have to be comprehended before application development can begin.

**InstantObjects offers:**

* Model realization in the Delphi IDE via integrated two-way tools.

* Object persistence in the most common relational databases or flat XML-based files.

* Object presentation via standard data-aware controls.

**Project Status**
The project is still managed by [Ethea S.r.l.](http://ethea.it/eng_default.asp), an italian company that uses InstantObjects for [InstantSolution Framework](http://ethea.it/eng_instantsolutions.htm#panoramica).
